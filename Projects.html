                        To test the effects of fin spacing on heat transfer rate, my team and I proposed and executed a simple experiment.
                        The main pieces of equipment were a custom machined heat sink and a hot plate. The heat sink was designed to be modular, where
                        the fins could easily be attached and reattached to the base plate at various spacings. The hot plate was set to a constant temperature, and 
                        the heat sink was allowed to reach steady state before measurements were taken.

                        LabView virtual instrument was created to visualize temperature over time and determine when steady state was reached.  
                        Using the Churchill and Chu Correlation, the Nusseult Number (Nu) and subsequently the convective heat transfer coefficient (h) were

                        7 fin widths, indicating that beyond a certain fin spacing, more fins are needed.

                        These natural convection results fit expectations, because intuitively, heat is trapped when fins are too close, preventing
                        effective heat dissipation and violating assumptions.  For example, \(T_\infty\) was assumed uniform and constant, but this is 
                        no longer true at sufficiently small spacings.  On the other hand, at large spacings, each fin must dissipate more heat for a 
                        larger portion of the base, which also reduces effectiveness.

                        Analysis of forced convection trails was less straightforward due to complicated dynamics and unideal experimental conditions among other factors.
                        However, we found that fin effectiveness stayed relatively constant for all spacings and temperature gradients weere much steeper than natural convection cases.

                    <div class="content-item-desc">
                        The steeper temperature gradients are due to increased heat dissipation from forced convection.  The constant Q values across fin spacings
                        indicate that fin spacing does not significantly affect heat dissipation in forced convection cases, which is likely due to the prevention of heat
                        accumulation between fins by the air flow.

                        Overall, results matched expectations and the optimal fin spacing was found to be ~3.5 fin widths for natural convection cases.  We acknowledge that
                        our experiment was limited by factors such as the imprecise temperature measurement methods and non-uniform airflow across all fins.

                        I collaborated with a team of four to create a macroscale MEMS pressure sensor.  As shown in the figure above, the walls of 
                        the sensor were angled at 54.7 degrees to facilitate fabrication at the micro or nano scale.  Strain gauges were 
                        adhered between two silicone rubber membranes, which were screwed down and sealed with glue.  
                        Since strain gauge/Wheatstone bridge readings were diffcult to consistently track on digital multimeters, we built a 
                        LabView virtual instrument to output voltage-time graphs. Experimental results showed a linear trend at pressures of 0.5-1.5psi.

                        As shown in the figure above, the sensor isn't reliable at pressures beyond 1.5psi.  Since the

                        begin to slip due to poor adherance.  Air leakage through imperfect seals could've also limited the sensor's readable range.
